# Tableau
Project Tableau workbooks that I've worked on <br/>

This was a visualization I worked on with a team of people during grad school.  It utilized pulling data down from an API via R and then loading into a SQL database on AWS to perform various statistical analysis and machine algorithms to create a similarity score.  Tableau was then used to visualize the data and create a dashboard. <br/>
